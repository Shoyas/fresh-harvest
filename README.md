# 🚀 SM Technology – Frontend Developer Task Submission

Hello SM Technology Team! 👋  
Thank you for the opportunity to work on the **Frontend Developer Task**. I’ve built this project using **Next.js 15 with Turbopack**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, fully aligned with the provided Figma design and API documentation.

---

## 📁 Project Summary

**Goal:**  
Develop a fully responsive and pixel-perfect frontend based on the given Figma designs and integrate it with real backend APIs using Redux Toolkit Query.

> ⚠️ **Design Note:**  
> Due to export limitations in the Figma file, I manually inspected and implemented the layout. I used best judgment for styles where exact values weren’t available.
